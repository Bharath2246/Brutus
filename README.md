Brutus Bitcoin Private Key Brute Forcer

Brutus is a modified copy of Plutus 
Plutus Bitcoin Brute Forcer
Made by Isaac Delly
https://github.com/Isaacdelly/Plutus

It is modified to generate random private keys until it fits to the given bitcoin wallet address.

To use it, you have to write the bitcoin address in line 57.

Then start it with

python brutus.py

or for multi processes

python brutus.py -m

As brutus is using CPU, it is not very fast.
So you shouldn't expect to find the key in this or in your next life.

It was more an idea to modify the original script to brute force for a specific address instead for balances.
A little "play around".

Have fun with it.

Would be happy fpr a coffee cup donation.
